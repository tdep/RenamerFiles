# RenamerFiles

**A file renamer.** 

RenamerFiles is a short Python program to batch rename files within a given directory. Say, for example, you transfer
a bunch of photos from your digital camera or phone to your computer but don't like how every file is named "IMG_9XXX.jpg"
or "19991231_235959.jpg". Well, this little bundle of joy will let you pick a base name and how you want to sequence it
for all the photos in a specified directory.
